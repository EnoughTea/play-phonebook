# Play Phonebook example #

This is a learning project for a Scala Play framework, a simple phonebook with CRUD operations, forms validation, working CSRF setup and Slick-based DB with migrations. Test coverage with ScalaTest goes without saying.

Below is a short design document which I used as a guide.

## Design outline ##
#### Phonebook structure ####
  * Phonebook consists of phonebook entries, which is a combination of a name and a phone number, e.g. `John Doe â€” +1 202 555-0167`.
  * Name and phone number are strings limited by 1024 symbols. Any symbol is allowed in a name, while in a phone number letters are forbidden.
  * Duplicate entries (same name and phone number) are forbidden.
#### User  ####
  * Entries are shown on a `/entries` page as a sequence sorted from oldest to newest, with pagination.
  * Entries can be added on `/enties/new`, edited on `/entries/:id` and removed on `/entries/:id/delete` pages.
  * From the `/entries` page, it is possible to search entries by name or phone number.
#### UI ####
  * Errors and notifications should be presented on the 'main' `/entries` page in some sensible manner, like Bootstrap alerts.
  * UI does not matter much; it should use Twitter Bootstrap and be at least somewhat pleasant to look at.

#### Tech stuff ####  
  * Application should be localizable.
  * Entries are stored in in-memory H2 database.
  * Database schema should be created using migrations and populated with a few random entries when app is started.
  * No sync handlers, everything is async.
